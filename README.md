# Code for Interaction-Aware Motion Planning for Autonomous Vehicles with Multi-Modal Obstacle Uncertainties in Multi-Vehicle Scenarios

This version contains the implementation for the comparison between **Sequence-based Optimization** and **Policy-based Optimization** [1], [2].

Full code will be published if the paper can be accepted.
